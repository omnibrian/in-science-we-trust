Global warming is an issue that should concern everyone regardless of their backgrounds yet has become a point of contention, dividing people based on their political affiliations in the United States. Here, we summarize and discuss the paper written by Hmielowski et al. in 2014 titled “An attack on science? Media use, trust in scientists, and perceptions of global warming”. We offer insights about further studies on this topic and how this one in particular could have been improved. We also included the main researcher’s ideas on what he would have done differently to better the multi-wave analysis on the media’s role in the public’s belief in climate change.
