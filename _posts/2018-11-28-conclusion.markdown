We found that the article was very interesting and accurately demonstrated the influence of the media on public opinion concerning global warming. Both ourselves and the main researcher of the article agreed that more research should be conducted to assess differences within the population and how these may have influenced the results of the surveys. Including another wave of data would have provided additional support and a better representation of ‘trust in scientists’ as a mediating factor. Further, allowing for other measures of trust in science would give greater reliability for the findings of the study. Finally, in the present-day political climate, it is more important now than ever for unity to better address this issue that should transcend any political affiliations. This debate does not offer any new insights, it only prevents anyone from finding solutions, making it increasingly important to bridge this divide and combine forces on this global matter.
